* Alternatively, use Python to run the server

In the terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. 
* Python 2.x

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.)

* Python 3.x

`python -m http.server 8000`

If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
